## Description
Valodex is a website based on one of the most popular first person shooter games currently available called Valorent. This website will allow you to navigate different components of the game, while giving you access to vital information that will better your understanding of the game. 

The motivation for building this website simply came from my love for the game. It was released in mid 2020 and has been climbing the ranks in popularity ever since it's release. The game is exhilarating yet frustrating due to it's intense competitiveness, but will leave you wanting to play more.
